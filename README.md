# city-explorer-api

**Author**: Steve Gant
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

In this lab assignment, you will begin building your own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that your server will manage.

## Getting Started

Create a new repo called `city-explorer-api` on GitHub, initialized with a README file. Clone it locally, and do all your work on a meaningfully-named feature branch off of `main`.
Use `npm install` to add the required dependencies to this project: `express`, `dotenv`, and `cors`.
Manually add the remaining files identified in the folder tree above. Put appropriate content into `.gitignore` and `.eslintrc.json`.

## Architecture

VSCode, JS, Express, dotenv, cors, HTML, React, NodeJS, 

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
